The year is seven hundred and twenty two (722) when war started at the lands of Yeress, which later is know as the war of eternity.
The kingdom of Aldor, the kingdom of Ash'vor, the kingdom of Tan'leri and the clan of the water mages all combined to face the 
imminent threat that came from the north, the necromancers. While the religion of all the tribes and kingdoms of Yeress is with the 
order of edernium, a order of gods which sole purpose is to preserve balance and peace in the realms of men, the necromancers on the
other hand believe only in the power of death and conjuring. Legend says that the necromancers conjured a monster from the depths 
of the great jade sea to fight by their side and flip the scales of balance that the order of edernium has fought for. The war ended with its 
consequences sons and daughters have been slain in this war, the cemeteries and graveyards were filled by the corpes of the soldiers
and the clan of the water mages vanished. Even though the armies of Yeress managed to push the necromancers back confinting them
at the farther north parth of the land the cost was too much and the war was practicly lost. The people started to recover and also 
lose their faith in the order for abandoning them in their finest our. Now six hundred years have passed since the war of eternity that
struck the lands of Yeress. While all those memories pass through your mind, you sudenly wake up with no memory how you got here...
